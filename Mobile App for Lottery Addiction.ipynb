    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project is related to addictions faced by people who become addicted towards lottery. Lottery addicts like compulsive gamblers start to burn through their savings and accumulate debts which in return brings many problems.\n",
    "- Our goal is to help a team of engineers of a medical institute build the app and for that, we need to create the logical core of the app. This includes helping the lottery addicts estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "- For this project, we will take into consideration [historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada.\n",
    "- The app idea comes from a medical institute which is specialized in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that can answer users the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "    - What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "    - What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we're going to write two functions that we'll be using frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `factorial()` — a function that calculates factorials\n",
    "- `combinations()` — a function that calculates combinations"
